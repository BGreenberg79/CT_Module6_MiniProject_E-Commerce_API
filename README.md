# E-Commerce API Mini-Project
## Programmed by Benjamin Greenberg
Mini-Project for Coding Temple

____
## Project Overview
This program uses the Flask Framework paired with Marshmallow and SQL Alchemy to create a series of tables for an E-Commerce API. Our program allows for us to Create, Read, Update, and Delete rows for the Tables our app creates that will store information regarding customers, their accounts, our product catalogue, and the orders our customers will place.

## Installation Instructions
My program can be downloaded from this project's [repository folder](https://github.com/BGreenberg79/CT_Module6_MiniProject_E-Commerce_API) in my Github account. Once downloaded the program can be run on either VS Code's terminal, Window's Command Prompt, or Apple's Terminal. You will also need to integrate POSTMAN or a similar API software to add, update, delete, or access information in the API.

## Special Thanks
I am very grateful for the curriculum Coding Temple has put together on a challenging, complex, and important topic to demonstrate the coding skills I am aquiring. I am also extremely grateful for my coach Sarah Stodder, who helped guide me in the right direction countless times during the creation of this product!
